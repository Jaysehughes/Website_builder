Python script to read data from .txt files and generate .html files

This is a script I made to help me automate the creation of my website.
If you want you try it for yourself, just change the paths to match your own.

input_folder = r"C:\Users\jayse\Documents\jaysehughes.com\website builder\projects"                #Change these to match your PC
output_folder = r"C:\Users\jayse\Documents\jaysehughes.com\website builder\jaysehughes.com"        #              |
main_file = r"C:\Users\jayse\Documents\jaysehughes.com\website builder\projects\main.txt"          #              |

It takes in a main file, as may project files as you want, and generates the appropriate webpage.
Additional HTML data can be added inside of the project files.
