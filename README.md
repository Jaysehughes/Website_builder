Python script to read data from .txt files and generate .html files

This is a script I made to help me automate the creation of my website.
If you want you try it for yourself, just change the paths to match your own.

It takes in a main file, as may project files as you want, and generates the appropriate webpage.
Additional HTML data can be added inside of the project files.
